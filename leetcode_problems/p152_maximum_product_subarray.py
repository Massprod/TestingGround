# Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return the product.
# The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.
# -------------------
# 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104  ,  -10 <= nums[i] <= 10
# The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
