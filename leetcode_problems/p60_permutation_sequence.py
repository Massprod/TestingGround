# The set [1, 2, 3, ..., n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.
# By listing and labeling all the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:
# "123"
# "132"
# "213"
# "231"
# "312"
# "321"
# Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.
# 1 <= n <= 9 | 1 <= k <= n!

    numbers = [_ for _ in range(1, n + 1)]
    permutation = ''
    k -= 1  # for 0 - based indexing
    for x in range(n):
        n -= 1

# Ok. Brute solution is fine, but there's no way to make it faster without rebuild.
# Google_time:
# The first position of an n length sequence is occupied by each of the numbers from 1 to n
# exactly n! / n that is (n-1)! number of times and in ascending order.
# So the first position of the kth sequence will be occupied by the number present at
#   index = k / (n-1)!(according to 1-based indexing).
#   index = (k - 1) / (n - 1)! (according to 0-based indexing) <- using this one.
# The currently found number can not occur again, so it is removed from the original n numbers
# and now the problem reduces to finding the ( k % (n-1)! )th permutation sequence of the remaining n-1 numbers.
# This process can be repeated until we have only one number left
# which will be placed in the first position of the last 1-length sequence.
# The factorial values involved here can be very large as compared to k.
# So, the trick used to avoid the full computation of such large factorials
# is that as soon as the product n * (n-1) * â€¦ becomes greater than k,
# we no longer need to find the actual factorial value.
# ----------------------------------------
# There's just no way to solve it for me without knowing this ^^
# Especially:
#   ! The first position of an n length sequence is occupied by each of the numbers from 1 to n
#     exactly n! / n that is (n-1)! number of times and in ascending order. !
