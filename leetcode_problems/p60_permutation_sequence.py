# The set [1, 2, 3, ..., n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.
# By listing and labeling all the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:
# "123"
# "132"
# "213"
# "231"
# "312"
# "321"
# Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.
# 1 <= n <= 9 | 1 <= k <= n!
