# A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
# Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index.
# If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
# You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.
# In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
# ----------------------
# 1 <= nums.length <= 1000  ,  -2 ** 31 <= nums[i] <= 2 ** 31 - 1
# nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.

# Time complexity: O(log n) -> default, binary search for any of breaking points(peaks) in the input_list => O(log n)
# n - len of input_list^^|
# Space complexity: O(1) -> 3 extra constant INTs, none of them depends on input => O(1)
# ----------------------
# Well in the end, did the same solution as I did in p154 but instead of recursion now it's iterative.
# Actually if I ever revisit 153 I can rebuild it to be constant_space.
# Because instead of slicing and searching in slice, we can just operate with indexes in original list like here.
# ----------------------
# Only way I know with searching in O(log n) is binary_search. How can we implement this?
# Break points?
# !
# an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array. !
# ^^Check first, last values to eliminate unique cases, because we cant check +1 -1 indexes for them.
# Search for a break_points instead of a some number, like in basic search.
# If something is getting bigger on the next index than it's always will break at some point into descending ->
# -> except unique case, with ascending to last_index, which we already checked.
# Same goes for descending, either unique case with everything descending into [0] index, or it breaks on the way.
# This break_points is always change from ascending to descending which is a PEAK, or
# from descending into ascending and if unique case is failed than there's 100% some other break point on the way,
# which will give us another PEAK. Should work.
