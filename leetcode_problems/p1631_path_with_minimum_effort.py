# You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike.
# You are given heights, a 2D array of size rows x columns, where heights[row][col]
#  represents the height of cell (row, col). You are situated in the top-left cell, (0, 0),
#  and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, (rows-1, columns-1) (i.e., 0-indexed).
# You can move up, down, left, or right, and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum effort.
# A route's effort is the maximum absolute difference in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.
# Return the minimum effort required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.

# Time complexity: O(m * n * log(m * n)) -> for each cell we traverse all it's adjacent neighbours => O(m * n)
# n - row length of input_matrix^^| and insert them into a heapq => O(log(m * n)) => O(m * n * log (m * n)).
# m - col length of input_matrix^^| In the worst case there's every cell in a heap.
# Auxiliary space: O(m * n) -> worst case == one cell -> one heap entry per cell => O(m * n).
# -----------------------
# Can we ignore BinarySearch?
# Like first idea was just use BFS to choose minimum resistance path and walk it, with remembering of maximum
#  effort we used. But we can't do this with just 4 neighbours, cuz then we need to traverse ALL paths possible.
# And my solution from Hints is very slow and Higher once's actually just using same ides with only BFS.
# But with choosing Minimum option not just from 4 neighbours but ALL the cells we added into a que so far.
# Which can be done with heapq(). Rebuild time.
# -----------------------
# First idea is use BFS, but we need only one size of step. And how we can find this step?
# Hint:
# !
# If you are given threshold k, check if it is possible
#  to go from (0, 0) to (n-1, m-1) using only edges of â‰¤ k cost.
# !
# Ok. Binary search for this K and BFS with this value, or DFS, but we still need to check all paths.
# Min_value == 0, Max_value == (max_in_matrix - min_in_matrix) <- BS limits.
# Well BFS can be done with just a matrix, but we need to find Max_value or use Max_constraint which is extra checks.
# Guess it's better to create Graph with all cells and their edges, like:
# {cell: {cell: edge_weight}}
# BFS on (0, 0) to check all paths to expand wih standard maintain of visited, and only add node if
# edge connecting it (edge <= K). If at any time we added last cell we need (n - 1, m - 1) we can return True.
# And try to make BS_check value Lower, if we can't get to this than we need Higher K.
# Should be correct. Working with random max_constraints, let's test.
