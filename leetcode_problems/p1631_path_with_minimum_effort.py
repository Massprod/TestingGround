# Time complexity: O(log k * (m * n)) -> creating graph by traversing whole input_matrix => O(m * n) ->
# k - max_effort - min_effort, between cells^^| -> binary search with found limits, and BFS for every check =>
# m - len of matrix row^^| => O(log k * (m * n)) <- worst case == BFS will lead to last cell for every check, but
# n - len of matrix col^^| with some path which includes every cell except 1 neighbour of the last_cell.
# Auxiliary space: O(m * n) -> dictionary with every cell as key, and dictionary as value which holds at max
#                           4 edges => O(4 * (m * n))? well they scale Linearly with input, but don't know how to calc
#                           this extra dictionaries with edges correctly. There will never be more than 4 keys inside.
#                           Extra set() with visited nodes inside of BFS which can in the worst case hold all nodes,
#                           except last one, cuz we're breaking on him => O(m * n).
#                           Should be correct to say, linear: O(m * n).
# -----------------------
# All correct, but this BS limits is still mystery for me.
# Random cases correct, some cases given as well, but others failing.
# And logic is correct, if we can make a path we're Lowering max_limit, and Increase min_limit when we can't.
# Always failing with, that. And always it's different limits for the tasks...
# Ok. Working with standard BS limits:
# (middle - 1) to lower
# (middle + 1) to increase
# and check until min <= max
# -----------------------
# First idea is use BFS, but we need only one size of step. And how we can find this step?
# Hint:
# !
# If you are given threshold k, check if it is possible
#  to go from (0, 0) to (n-1, m-1) using only edges of â‰¤ k cost.
# !
# Ok. Binary search for this K and BFS with this value, or DFS, but we still need to check all paths.
# Min_value == 0, Max_value == (max_in_matrix - min_in_matrix) <- BS limits.
# Well BFS can be done with just a matrix, but we need to find Max_value or use Max_constraint which is extra checks.
# Guess it's better to create Graph with all cells and their edges, like:
# {cell: {cell: edge_weight}}
# BFS on (0, 0) to check all paths to expand wih standard maintain of visited, and only add node if
# edge connecting it (edge <= K). If at any time we added last cell we need (n - 1, m - 1) we can return True.
# And try to make BS_check value Lower, if we can't get to this than we need Higher K.
# Should be correct. Working with random max_constraints, let's test.
