# Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
#
# The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times.
# You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.
# ----------------------
# n == nums.length
# 1 <= n <= 5 * 10 ** 4
# -10 ** 9 <= nums[i] <= 10 ** 9
# ----------------------
# Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?
