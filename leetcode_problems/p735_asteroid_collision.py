# We are given an array asteroids of integers representing asteroids in a row.
# For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size,
#   and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left).

# Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions.
# If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode.
# If both are the same size, both will explode.
# Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.

# Time complexity: O(n) -> traversing whole input_array, once => O(n) -> but there's WHILE loop inside which

#                           => we're going to add all 1 into an after_collide and when -10 encountered, extra
#                           traversing whole after_collide array with already size of (n - 1) to delete all elements
#                           and add -10 as a new asteroid => O(2n) => O(n).
# Auxiliary space: O(n) -> in the worst case every asteroid is negative or positive, and we're just adding them all =>
#                          => getting actual copy of input_array => O(n). On median is Î¸(log n).
# ----------------
# Only problem is what we need to consider?
# Every right and left collision or from what point?
# Ok. Made test4 -> we need only check collision with POSITIVE with NEGATIVE which comes after positives.
# Then it's just recreating with replacement of a last element.
