# Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one,
# which appears exactly once.
# Find the single element and return it.
# -----------------------
# You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.
# -----------------------
# 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104  ,  -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
# Each element in nums appears exactly three times except for one element which appears once.
