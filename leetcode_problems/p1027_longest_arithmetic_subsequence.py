# Given an array nums of integers, return the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in nums.
# Note that:
#   A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements
#       without changing the order of the remaining elements.
#   A sequence seq is arithmetic if seq[i + 1] - seq[i] are all the same value (for 0 <= i < seq.length - 1).
# ----------------------------
# 2 <= nums.length <= 1000
# 0 <= nums[i] <= 500
