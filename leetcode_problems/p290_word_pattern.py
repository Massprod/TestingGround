# Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern.

#   between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s.

# 1 <= s.length <= 3000
# s contains only lowercase English letters and spaces ' '.
# s does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
# All the words in s are separated by a single space.

#                             -> so we're traversing pattern as O(n) and extra checking all indexes in s => O(m) ->
#                             -> overall we're checking whole pattern and whole s => O(n + m).

#                           ! there's extra spaces between words, so it's (m - spaces_num)^^,
#                             but they're constant -> because every word is separated by other with 1 space. !
# --------------------
# Failed first commit, because missed part with reassigning same word for a multiple times.
# --------------------
# Well according to test5, order of reading should be considered,
# because there's a -> cat and b -> dog and if we ignore order it's should be correct(True).
# But correct answer is False, so we're reading in order.
# --------------------
# For a pairing between X and Y (where Y need not be different from X) to be a bijection,
# four properties must hold:
#   1 -> each element of X must be paired with at least one element of Y,
#   2 -> no element of X may be paired with more than one element of Y,
#   3 -> each element of Y must be paired with at least one element of X, and
#   4 -> no element of Y may be paired with more than one element of X.
# Guess ordering isn't problem and I need just to check evey symbol in pattern
# corresponds with exactly one string in s.
# !
# Here follow means a full match. !
# Or order should be the same?
# W.e let's read with correct order for now.
