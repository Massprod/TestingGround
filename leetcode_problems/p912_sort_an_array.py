# Time complexity: O(n * log n) -> The time complexity of Merge Sort isÎ¸(Nlog(N)) in all 3 cases
# n - len of input_array^^|        (worst, average, and best) as merge sort always divides the array
#                                  into two halves and takes linear time to merge two halves.
# Auxiliary space: O(n) -> we're always taking two halves from every input and using extra space to save them
#                          in left|right -> at max it will store same size as original array => O(n).
# ----------------------
# Done only 1 sorting task so far, and it's actually more Memory task.
# Previously used merge_sort which is O(n * log n).
# So, it should be correct to use it here even with O(n) extra space it's still OK on Time.
# Doubt someone expects from us creating of a new sorting method.
# Topic on that: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/
