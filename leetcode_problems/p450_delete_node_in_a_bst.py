# Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST.
# Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.
# Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:
#   - Search for a node to remove.
#   - If the node is found, delete the node.
# --------------------
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10 ** 4].
# -10 ** 5 <= Node.val <= 10 ** 5
# Each node has a unique value.
# root is a valid binary search tree.
# -10 ** 5 <= key <= 10 ** 5

# Time complexity: O(n) -> search for a correct Node is standard BST => O(log n) ->
# n - nodes of input_BST^^| -> and search for minimum|maximum in left|right subtrees is also only a part => O(log n) ->
#                           -> but in the worst case I need to rebuild, or it's still full search and then O(n) ->
#                           -> like, case with deleting a node with Left + Right child and Left child is having
#                           right child as well, and this RightSubtree will have only 1 line with w.e number of nodes,
#                           we will traverse all of these nodes to get Minimum => O(n).
#                           Ok. Changed, now we will check if there's way to replace it with Right|Left child,
#                           without searching in them. Now it should be faster in some cases, but still should be O(n).
#                           Because some cases with just 3 nodes and we need to delete some leaf, which is actually a
#                           node == 3. So everything will be used once anyway. On median Î˜(log n).
# Auxiliary space: O(n) -> if we traverse everything, then we're store everything in a stack => O(n).
# --------------------
# Ok. Done. Not good-looking, but working solution. Pretty sure there's better standard way of doing it.
# But if I'm capable of doing this on my own it's better to delay googling.
# Basic rule is that, I don't know or there no way to delete node just by node == None,
# we need to reassign nodes which pointing it to new ones.
# And every node we're deleting if it's having any Left child with Right child in it,
# we need to find maximum value in this child, otherwise it will conflict with BST standard.
# Every parent having Less values in left_subtree and higher in right_subtree.
# Same goes for right_child of delete Node, but now we need minimum value in this subtree.
# And if there's no childs we can just delete this node, reassign it as None for pointer.
