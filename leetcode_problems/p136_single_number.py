# Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one.
# Find that single one.
# You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.
# --------------------------
# 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104  ,  -3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
# Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
