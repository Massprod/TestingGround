# Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer.
# The returned integer should be non-negative as well.
# 0 <= x <= 231 - 1
# You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.
# For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.
