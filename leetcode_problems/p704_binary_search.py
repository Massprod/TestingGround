# Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target,
# write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.
#
# You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
# --------------------
# 1 <= nums.length <= 10 ** 4  ,  -10 ** 4 < nums[i], target < 10 ** 4
# All the integers in nums are unique.
# nums is sorted in ascending order.
