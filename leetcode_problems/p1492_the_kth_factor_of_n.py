# You are given two positive integers n and k. A factor of an integer n is defined
#       as an integer i where n % i == 0.
# Consider a list of all factors of n sorted in ascending order,
#       return the kth factor in this list or return -1 if n has less than k factors.
# --------------------
# 1 <= k <= n <= 1000
# Follow up:
# Could you solve this problem in less than O(n) complexity?
