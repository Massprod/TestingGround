# Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
#  A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
# Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.
#  Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words.
#  The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.
# -------------------
# 1 <= s.length <= 104
# s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
# There is at least one word in s.
