# Time complexity: O(n * (log n) + n) -> sorting input_list with built_in => O(n * (log n)) ->
# n - len of input_list^^| -> traversing through whole input_list, checking every index as min or max points => O(n) ->
#                          -> O(n * (log n) + n)
# Space complexity: O(1) -> python built_in sort() => O(1) -> 4 extra constants, doesn't depend on input => O(1)
# --------------------
# Total subs for len == n ->  nC0 + nC1 + nC2 + â€¦ nCn = 2 ** n.
# For a future use -> always remember that bit_shift is faster than using ** or *,
#                     in this case is faster to do left_shift for 1 to option times,
#                     2 ** n => 1 << n, because left_shit is equal to (any * (2 ** n)) but it's faster.
