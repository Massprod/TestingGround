# Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.
#
# There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again
#   by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node
#   that tail's next pointer is connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle.
# Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
# Do not modify the linked list.
# ---------------------
# The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
# -105 <= Node.val <= 105
# pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.
# ---------------------
# Follow up: Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?

# Time complexity: O(n + log n) -> traversing input_list once => O(n) -> extra nodes will be checked after
# n - len of input_list^^| we found that there's cycle (X = K * C â€“ Y) <- X number of Nodes for slow,fast points =>
#                          => O(2 * log n) -> O(n + (log n))
# Auxiliary space: O(1) -> nothing extra, only links to already existing nodes as constants => O(1)
# !
#   changing *Space complexity*, because it can be called like this, but it's not really correct.
#   I was using it because of one_style for every problem, and it can be called like this but Auxiliary is correct.
#   Leaving previous problems like it is, but from now on using more correct terming. !
# ---------------------
# Not really a big difference in Space or speed, because we're just storing LINKS to the actual nodes,
# not creating new one. And im curious if we can count this as O(1) -> because there was p148 in which
# all solutions with O(1) I found claim's to be constant space, but having recursion's and storing links same way.
# So maybe I could say like them => HASH operations and recursion for a linked list is just O(1) space.
# W.e it's still a good task, at least now I know about Floyd algorithm for finding cycles and starting nodes of it.
# ---------------------
# Not going to skip O(1) space solution, but there's no way I could solve it without extra info.

# Seems working, but there's no info about what we return if there's NO cycle.
# ! Output: no cycle ! What this? By default, we're returning ListNode, so it's None or False like in p141.

# Do not modify the linked list. !
# Ok. Now it's time to use dictionary. Last one I know how to solve it without extra info.
# So if I hit time_limit or commit correctly I will check what O(1) space here,
# because there's some big_math again, and without extra_theory practically impossible to solve.
