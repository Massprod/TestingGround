# Time complexity: O(n) -> 1 + 1 + 1 - 3 loops == 3n, worst case looping through n elements of input.
# Space complexity: O(1) -> no extra space used.

# First of all we need to change our list to a type of 1.......n only positive values.
# It's cant be done without sorting which takes extra space. Python sort() is at lowest (n * log n).
# List need's to be changed inplace without using anything extra.
# Instead of sorting, we're marking every negative value with something more than max_pos (length(list)).
# Now we can ignore all negatives as marked.
# Changing every value which more than max_pos to (max_pos + any) -> cuz by logic of a 1.......n list ->
# value equal to n + 1, can't have index inside of this list. Making this value non_placeable.
# Next, filtering out values which can be placed inside all positive list. Ignoring marked as (max_pos + any).
# If value can be placed in all_positive list than it's index will be (value - 1) -> 1 = [0], 2 = [1] etc.
# That's why we're taking value which is not marked as negative or non_placeable,
# and allocating its index by (value - 1) -> changing  value at this index to negative (marked).
# After we marked every value there's going to be positive values only on missing indexes.
# [0]mark-[1]mark-[2]mark-[3]mark-[4]pos-[5]mark-...etc
# Simply scrolling through this list and finding the lowest index, will give as missing minimal positive.
# If there's no positive values in a list than it's out of the LENGTH bound and equal to (LENGTH + 1).
# All values > LENGTH is non_placeable.
# Returning max_pos + 1 as highest integer -> length == last_index - 1 ->
# integer which can be placed at this index in only positive list 1......n -> last_index + 1 == length ->
# which leave us with next integer last_index + 1 + 1 == length + 1
# -----------------------------
# Well now, it's HARD problem.

#
# Ok. Python sort() takes at lowest Î©(n), violating the rule with memory. Found the catch.
# -----------------------------
# ! "No extra space" implies some amount of space,
# usually exactly n, is available via the input, and no more should be used !
# -> Ok. That's a catch I guess, not available to use min_pos as a constant.
# -----------------------------
# ! a space complexity of O(1) means that the space required by the algorithm to process data is constant;
# it does not grow with the size of the data on which the algorithm is operating. !
# -----------------------------
# ! For an algorithm to take constant extra space,
# the extra variables used to solve it should not change with the input size !
# But all googled solution's at least uses LEN(NUMS) as constant n, which depends on input size. Hmm
# -----------------------------
# Where's the catch? Hard problem, can't be so easy...
# We allowed to sort, and minimal positive int is 1
# If there's not presented any value equal to 1 it's always return 1,
# and if there's 1, next 2 with same logic. Hmm
