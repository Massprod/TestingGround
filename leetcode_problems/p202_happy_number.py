# Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.
# A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
#   - Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
#   - Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay),
#        or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
#   - Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
# Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.
# -----------------------
# 1 <= n <= 2 ** 31 - 1
